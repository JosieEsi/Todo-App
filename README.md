# TODO App README

Description
This README provides a guide for designing a todo-app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A simple and intuitive To-Do list application to help you stay organized and manage your tasks effectively.

Design and Implementation
The art gallery website was designed using VScode and was deployed by hosting it on a web server. The app was made responsive by using CSS media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. Test your website in various web browsers and on different devices to ensure it looks and functions as expected.
